# Insight Magician - Development Summary

## Project Overview

**Insight Magician** is a database query dashboard application that allows users to upload SQLite databases and create custom query widgets. Each widget is a flip card with SQL query editor on the back and results table with pagination on the front.

## Key Features Implemented

### Core Functionality
- **SQLite File Upload**: Drag & drop database file upload with validation
- **Schema Browser**: View database structure (tables, columns, types, constraints)
- **File Validation**: Magic byte checking to ensure valid SQLite files
- **Security**: Path traversal protection, prepared statements, file size limits

### User Interface
- **Upload Interface**: Drag-and-drop area with visual feedback states
- **Schema Sidebar**: Slides in from left showing database structure
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during upload and processing

## Technical Stack

### Backend
- **Runtime**: Bun (JavaScript runtime with built-in SQLite support)
- **Server**: Bun.serve() with REST API endpoints
- **Database**: bun:sqlite for SQLite operations
- **File Handling**: Secure upload with validation

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Vanilla JavaScript with ES6 modules
- **Bundling**: Bun's built-in bundler via HTML imports
- **Styling**: CSS with animations and responsive design
- **Components**: Modular architecture (upload, schema, widgets)

### Development Tools
- **Biome**: Code formatting and linting
- **Makefile**: Development commands (dev, format, lint, test)
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD pipeline for code quality
- **Testing**: Bun test framework with unit and integration tests

## API Endpoints

- `POST /api/upload` - Upload SQLite database file
- `GET /api/schema` - Get database schema (tables, columns)
- `POST /api/query` - Execute SQL query with pagination (planned)

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Development Environment ✅
- [x] Set up Biome for formatting and linting
- [x] Create Makefile with dev, format, lint, test commands
- [x] Add GitHub Actions workflow for code quality checks
- [x] Set up basic project structure with test directories

### Phase 2: Foundation ✅
- [x] Set up Bun server with file upload endpoint
- [x] Implement SQLite file handling and schema introspection
- [x] Create upload interface and schema sidebar

### Phase 3: Basic Widget System (In Progress)
- [ ] Create flip card widget component with CSS animations
- [ ] Add "Add Widget" button in top-right corner
- [ ] Implement basic SQL query editor (back of card)

### Phase 4: Query Execution & Results (Planned)
- [ ] Add query execution API endpoint
- [ ] Display results in table format (front of card)
- [ ] Implement flip button to switch between edit/view modes

### Phase 5: Pagination System (Planned)
- [ ] Implement LIMIT/OFFSET pagination logic
- [ ] Add prev/next navigation controls
- [ ] Track pagination state per widget

### Phase 6: Polish & UX (Planned)
- [ ] Improve error handling and user feedback
- [ ] Add responsive design optimizations
- [ ] Optimize performance for large datasets

## Key Technical Decisions

1. **Bun Over Node**: Leverages Bun's speed and built-in SQLite support
2. **Vanilla JS Frontend**: Avoids framework complexity, uses Bun's bundling
3. **SQL-First UX**: Direct SQL editing for maximum flexibility
4. **Flip Card Pattern**: Intuitive edit/view mode switching
5. **Security-First**: Validation, sanitization, and prepared statements

## Challenges & Solutions

### SQLite Reserved Keywords
**Problem**: SQL queries failed with "near 'Order': syntax error" for tables with reserved keyword names.
**Solution**: Added proper quoting around table names in all SQL queries: `"${tableName}"` instead of `${tableName}`.

### Git Repository Structure
**Problem**: Files committed with "insight-magician/" prefix due to incorrect git initialization.
**Solution**: User fixed by removing .git from parent directory and reinitializing in project directory.

### Schema Sidebar Positioning
**Problem**: Schema sidebar covered the "Add Widget" button when opened from the right.
**Solution**: Moved schema sidebar to slide in from the left side instead of right.

## Current Status

- **Completed**: File upload, schema introspection, responsive UI
- **Working**: SQLite database handling with proper security measures
- **Next**: Implementing flip card widgets with SQL query editing

## Development Guidelines

- Use Bun for all JavaScript runtime operations
- Prefer vanilla JavaScript over frameworks
- Follow Biome formatting and linting rules
- Write comprehensive tests for all features
- Maintain security best practices
- User handles server management (no auto-starting dev servers)

## User Flow

1. User uploads SQLite database file via drag-and-drop
2. System validates file and displays database schema in sidebar
3. User clicks "Add Widget" to create new query widget
4. Widget starts in edit mode with SQL textarea
5. User writes query and executes to see results
6. Results display with automatic pagination
7. User can flip between edit and view modes

This project demonstrates a clean, security-focused approach to building database query interfaces with modern JavaScript tooling.
