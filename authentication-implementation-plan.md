# Server-Side Application Database & Authentication Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

**Goal**: Transform Insight Magician from an open-access tool to a secure, user-authenticated dashboard platform.

**Scope**: 7 phases implementing application database, magic link authentication, route protection, and frontend integration.

**Approach**: Incremental implementation starting with database foundation, building through authentication infrastructure, and completing with UI integration.

**Architecture Context**: Extends existing Bun.serve application with authentication layer while maintaining complete separation from user-uploaded databases.

## Current State Analysis

### Database Architecture
- **User Databases**: SQLite files uploaded to `./uploads/` directory (read-only access)
- **DatabaseManager**: Handles user database connections (`lib/database.js`)
- **No App Database**: Zero persistent application state or user management

### Authentication & Sessions  
- **No Authentication**: Completely open access to all functionality
- **Client-Side Only**: Widget/dashboard state in browser `sessionStorage`
- **No Server Sessions**: No user identity, session management, or access control

### Server Architecture
- **Bun.serve**: Modern runtime with route-based handling (`index.js`)
- **API Routes**: `/api/upload`, `/api/schema`, `/api/query`, `/api/chat`
- **Static Serving**: Frontend components and assets from `/public/`

### Frontend Architecture
- **Component-Based SPA**: Modular UI components (`public/components/`)
- **No Auth Awareness**: UI assumes unrestricted access
- **Session Storage**: Local persistence only, no server coordination
